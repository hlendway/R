There were also generous professional development opportunities. In analytics, you worked with some very smart people and had a great deal of room to grow your skills and learn on the job. The academic atmosphere was great too, and the collegiality truly existed among the team.","The focus of the entire analytics group turned to marketing, which meant that any other projects were deprioritized in favor of simpler reporting or data order taking, making the job very boring after a while.Salary was low. There appeared to be a ceiling to professional advancement. Benefits were average, although the dress for your day policy was a good addition.Finally, analytics leadership was non existent. Any vision that existed for the group was mere lip service, not discussed very often, and no tangible roadmap for making the vision happen. This lack of a vision made the job feel like a dead end.","Capella really needs to get back to where they were five years ago, when they set out to differentiate based on a quality and innovative product that helps learners achieve their educational goal. To do this, they need to use ALL of their resources, human and otherwise, and not squander talent. Give lower level people an opportunity to contribute and reward them when they do.In terms of the recommendation, I would recommend Capella to someone looking to start their career in analytics. This is a supportive atmosphere and there is appetite for data analysis across the organization.

Lots of threats from mid-level management, pretty much on a daily basis. Metrics are unrealistic and constantly changing. Once you finally meet their targets, they increase the target or add new metrics that are also unrealistic. They do nothing to help or assist their employees. They're honestly useless; I'm not sure what exactly it is that they do or why they are even receiving a paycheck. Advice to Management: Care about your employees - they are people too. Sometimes people have more going on in life than just KPIs and numbers. Provide your employees with the tools they need to succeed - whether its showing them the proper method of doing something, or helping with finding adequate staffing, be a leader and be truly helpful and supportive whenever possible. Take care of your employees and they will take care of your customers- get it together Walgreens! I don't mind working hard for you but come on, approve a vacation once in a while! Also, you better pray you don't get sick because somehow finding coverage is impossible and you will be reprimanded from your DM and scheduler as to why you decided to wake up with the flu.

If you are one who can't handle change and won't invest time to experience the whole organization, then you are probably not going to be a fit. I would imagine that is a reason behind a majority of the negative reviews you see here. The potential at this company is there and many people see it. The rapid evolution away from small business feel and culture to a larger organization is apparent and great to experience. If you spend only a little bit of time looking outside the confines of your day to day you will find so many are wanting and looking for opportunities to collaborate to make the company and products better. Since few spend the time to do this, we still find ourselves silo'd. Those that break those barriers, flourish in their careers and impact to SPS.","Honestly, it is true the pay and benefits might be slightly behind. The important factor is the company has recognized this and made significant strides to move the needle to change that. The problem is, change can't happen overnight yet people expect it.There is a problem with a consistent, universal customer-centric attitude. As a service-based company, customers should be number 1. Instead, there is a heavy ""win-now"" mentality which can lead to short-sighted decisions. I see this as a conflict within because there are some who focus heavily on the customer while others are looking for revenue at all costs.Yes, there are management problems. Too often are there situations where employees feel out of the loop, and disengaged. Majority of these problems can be fixed rather easily if managers simply prioritize their employees. Focus on accountability, data-driven metrics and employee/team development activities (weekly team meets/ one-on-ones).","Customer-focus. No exception. If you understand the customer, focus on bettering their experience and improving their day, revenue will follow. There is a big difference between ""being a yes-man"" to a customer and understanding their world equally if not better than them and challenging them. I have seen situations where this is executed effectively and competition magically disappears.Focus on employee retention & training - our leadership position requires that we guide customers/prospects with best practices and recommendations. Those expectations cannot be set nor met correctly if we lack the experience to guide them."

There is little mentoring except for software developers, and very little scope for those who are not software developers to use what they have learned.Promotions are hard to come by. Generally those are promoted who have least respect for the company culture and values.","Many managers would benefit from some management training. Many of the managers are super-smart people, but lack people and mentoring skills.On-boarding is not very good. New hires are expected to learn the company business, the structure and some very complicated coding frameworks more-or-less on their own. It's not good enough to teach the culture and values theory - new software developers need to be walked through the code frameworks so that they can write better quality code sooner.Identify your best sales people and make sure they teach others how to sell your products before they leave."

Even if you don’t necessarily agree with each other all the time professionally, on a personal level the people at The Nerdery are generally really good-natured and fun to be around.-Employees in the operations related departments do still work really really hard to try and make this an enjoyable place to work, and that can never be recognized enough. Even if there isn’t quite the same spirit as there used to be (which is something that just can’t be manufactured no matter how hard you try), day to day The Nerdery is still a more pleasant environment than most.-There are some new people coming in, particularly at the higher level, who seem incredibly smart and capable. This is encouraging to see and they're valuable to learn from.","-Lacking strong diversity AND inclusion practices. A previous reviewer said this well. Just because the tech industry as a whole isn’t doing so hot doesn’t mean The Nerdery can’t and shouldn’t do better (especially considering most tech companies blame the “pipeline problem” and The Nerdery essentially has its own pipeline in Prime Academy). There’s a promising employee-led group developing right now, but leadership’s initiative/communication around diversity and inclusion has been lackluster. If we’re truly trying to become a company that’s rooted in client/customer experience, then you need to have a workforce that actually represents and can speak to the full spectrum of that experience. This isn’t an issue of “doing the right thing” because you’re being publicly or privately pressured, it’s an issue of catching up with the 21st century and actually making your company–and its work–better. Our leaders are smart enough to recognize this, so I’d like to see them be ambitious enough to act on it.-There’s a recent pervasive and unsettling attitude among some employees/senior leadership (as evidenced in a few of the newer reviews here) that those employees who lament some of the less admirable aspects of The Nerdery’s evolution over the last couple years are simply “resistant to change,” or “incapable of growing up.”If anything, it’s this dismissive and belittling tone that’s become the most disappointing aspect of The Nerdery for me. Rather than alienating those employees who care so much about the company that they’ve stuck with it for years and years, why not work harder to embrace them? Why not put aside your own limited personal experience and dig deeper to understand their perspective so you can parse out the real value in it?The Nerdery isn’t the first company to experience this kind of change and it won’t be the last–employees who are frustrated at how its being handled understand this, they aren’t children–but how an organization chooses to navigate it says a lot about the character of its culture/leadership. Right now, I see a lot of smart, valuable people coming into the organization, but I also see a lot of smart, valuable people leaving because they no longer feel heard or respected. Repeatedly spouting off the disingenuous message “If you’re stuck in the old ways, drink the positivity Kool-Aid or get out,” doesn’t feel like the most mature or healthy way to lead an organization.Truthfully, this seems to be what happens in most companies of this size going through this kind of transition–but that doesn’t mean it has to be. I’m sad to see The Nerdery, for all its wonderful and unique qualities, be so wholly unexceptional in this regard.","Keep hiring new, energized, and ambitious people, but not to the detriment of your existing employees. Work harder to find the constructive in what they're telling you with their words (as annoying as The Buzz can be, it can still provide insightful discourse) and their actions (i.e. emotionally checking out, leaving the company) rather than dismissing it as run of the mill negativity and resistance to change.

Although there has been a lot of change in the past year, it's the type of change that is going to move the company forward and enable them to compete against the large digital consulting companies. This up-leveling will allow the company to bring in the types of clients and projects our Nerds want to work with and on.The Nerdery is extremely accepting of people from diverse backgrounds and with diverse interests.

It's not long before all the wonderful people that once made up this place are also gone. There's entire departments that don't even have the same people they did less than a year ago.- Compensated for billable, hourly work beyond 40 hours/week if you work in Production- Dogs in the office- Free snacks and beer (kind of?)","- Brand identity crisis. Our own website reflects this; it's embarrassing.- 0 vision from upper management and poor communication. Lots of unkept promises. Continuous ""rescue mission"" vision and goal restarts. You get the impression you're constantly being lied to, which is disappointing at best and insulting at worst.- In a recent all-company meeting with our EC team, a woman in the audience asked about our executive team's focus and plan for hiring more women in leadership. The response? ""We have 2. And I think that's good."" Just pathetic. If you're lying to us about everything else, you may as well lie and make it sound like you care about opportunities for women in leadership at The Nerdery.- We receive at least a couple of emails every day with announcements for people putting their notice in.- The company can't hire fast enough to keep up with the turnover so all projects are in a constant resourcing crisis state (it doesn't help that our Resourcing Department is comprised of a whole 2 people).- No real professional development support. HR has never provided this and they eliminated the role of professional development managers who once provided this valuable service -- a benefit that used to set The Nerdery a part from every other chop shop. They promoted a bunch of ""working managers"" who have no idea how to actually manage people and are expected to do so without experience while also balancing a full-time, billable workload. They said this was because the previous professional development managers created more barriers than collaboration and now we're empowered to manage ourselves (which actually means doing more work with less support for the same pay). Common guys, we're not idiots. I would mention career path in this point, but there is none here.- They organized everyone into ""cross-functional teams"" because that probably sounded nice and ""diverse"" on paper, but what it has resulted in is a disconnection from your expertise and support on improving within your domain. Picture starting as a UX Designer and your manager and team knowing nothing about InVision or any UX templates and your PM having to actually share these things with you because you have no actual UX department to rely on.- These gaps in support add a ton more responsibility to Project Management's responsibilities: professional development and coaching, resourcing, etc.- The Nerdery Holiday Party was once an epic celebration and deemed a huge Nerd benefit. They rented out unique and fun venues, had crazy decorations, and flew everyone in from all locations. It felt like a great extended family get-together. This year, they are now hosting the party at the office (I already work more than 50 hours per week, I don't need to spend my little free time at the office too). They are no longer flying everyone in; they said we'd probably prefer to have more ""intimate"" parties at each location instead (which is of course code for budget cuts). Please don't insult our intelligence and act like this is for the benefit of the employees when it actually only benefits your bottom line.- People used to gather in the Nerditorium for a ""Bottlecap"" presentation every Friday. Barely anyone attends these now. They had to even take a poll to see if we should still have them. Why? Because people don't want to be at The Nerdery. People used to actually WANT to spend their free-time here. You can't create that kind of culture; it's an organic result of being a place where people actually want to BE.- It's a ghost town. Many employees retreat to working at home because...again, they don't want to be in the office. This office used to be so loud and social that there were complaints about it and now I can hear a penny drop on any given day.- Management keeps rolling out new roles without telling anyone in the company what these roles even entail, which creates all sorts of roles and responsibilities issues and questions on projects.- The sales process is completely cutoff from reality. This has always been the case. Our estimating process is off and then the projects get thrown over to Production who then has to consistently deliver the bad news. I can't remember the last project I worked on where we didn't have some sort of major resourcing, budget, or timeline crisis. This is a symptom of a deeper problem.If you're still reading this, do yourself a favor and pass on applying here right now. It's only a sad shell of what it used to be (except for the company name, which sounds deceptively ""fun"" and carefree). Maybe they figure themselves in 2 years. Maybe they don't and they sell. I honestly hope for the latter because trying to be something you're not is not a lie anyone wants to be a part of.","Hire an actual Change Management expert.

They will also match 3% of your 401k contribution for RR employees","You will only be hired as a ready reserve and then it will literally take years to get a full time position. I have been with the company for 2 plus years and have applied for over 60 FT positions all over the country and haven’t gotten one face to face interview. As a ready reserve (RR) you do not get raises after your first year, you receive no medical or dental insurance, and no paid benefit time such as sick, vacation, or holiday. You are mandated to work no more than 1400 hours a year on a fixed schedule, which changes every 6 months. My station mandates that all RR agents work that 1400 hours a year so finding a FT job to work around the twice a year changing schedule is nearly impossible. Also, if flights are delayed and you work an afternoon shift, you are mandated to stay (sometimes many many hours) until your delayed flight takes off. This will interfere with any secondary job or obligations you have outside of your part time job with Delta. Delayed flights happen daily so YES, it will definitely happen to you and repeatedly. I have seen FT positions be filled in a way which is not accordIng to policy or seniority. The culture and values that the company says they have are often quite different than what I see happening at my station with management. My station has a high management turnover. In my short 2.5 years of being there, there is not one general manager, nor operating service manager, that was there when I started. Our current management seems to change the rules every 3 months to suit their needs. No consistency in enforcing rules/policies makes for disgruntled employees.

Cintas will beup front at orientation , noting thier Culture is different and the expectations are high . Like most ,You either perform quickly or your gone .Yes the 3 month rule is in effect for both sides . You are expected to Maintain /Grow the business as any business would expect given a business or Corporation is not in business to lose money people !!Yes , you will get kicked around and you will learn very soon if you have what it takes or not . The winters are grueling and miserable , the summers are Hot and exausting in our region . The loads were aweful and like others noted missing product constantly to deliver to customers ..Route loads Are a roll of the dice and no one is thier to manage your business or route given that is your job , no one has time to baby sit you given they have an immense amount of thier own duties to handle . G&k was a little more patient than Cintas though and from a management stand point bar none more supportive ...G&k - Definitely more family oriented and the culture /Completely opposite from CintasCintas is just better at Squeezing blood out of you and the turnip greens given thier strict guidelines for revenue and Bottom line .The industry is flooded with competition, Cintas seems to be weeding those out 1 by 1 .Unitog / Nuway , now G&k just to name 3 heads of once powerful companies taken out ....THE MERGER - Let me remind everyone , I would think the board of executives would have had to vote on the Merger or Sale of G&K ? I met the CEO of G&K multiple times , he was actually a really great guy , for a CEO, he was even more human if you will than some of upper level executives and even GM I worked with .I never met the CEO of Cintas in the 8years I was with them.. Stop blaming the CEO Doug Milroy ..Good luck with the Merger GK and What's coming Down your pipeline in regards to the changes and expectations headed your way ..You thought the expectations were tuff before ?Just wait lol ......","Worked my way up From Driver to Executive level , my days on route sucked !! They were brutal beyond imagination , loads were aweful , Management was Great , Sales was Great , you had all the freedom in the world but you had better hit your numbers !! In Management you could finally make a difference given you were on the same playing field as the plant manager who you always had to battle with as a Route Rep ..From my personal experience on either side, if you do not have the blood ,sweat and tears mentallity or you your one to develope later on you will need a GM or Manager who will protect you long enough to develope or you will not make it .If you are not familiar with this business or Arena I highly Suggest opting to go another way or start with a different company . Mergers can be messy with all the transitions ...If you do happen to get hired on with Now parent Company Cintas , I suggest Sleeping with your Cintas Football or Glove every night because that is all you will be eating ,breathing, and sleeping until you leave the company . You better have your shirt tucked in , your pants pressed ,Shaved and in 9 's and yes that even means the route guys .. I have seen guys chewed and sent to the plant to have thier shirts and pants pressed before going on route . You better not miss a meeting , show up late or call in Sick. Yes that is pressed uniforms before going on route to pick up dirty clothes and Nasty Rags .They do not highly recruit military personal for no reason , Cintas is structured machine and they have the same expectations from the ground up ! From thier route guys to thier Management up to Executive level , they are intense and a in your face culture .. They do not Mess around ....If you do not bring back honey for the Cintas queen then you are gone ...... It's that simple ..","Good Luck ..."

This guy is a joke and the laughing stock of the company, but honestly in the end he’ll be the one laughing all the way to the bank because long after he’s gone the damage he has done to this company will still linger.5) practices in general - this place has some funky accounting practices going on. Supervisors encouraged to bring truck loads of materials over from offsite storage only to drop them on the floor and claim a percentage of revenue based on “work started” on the project. Labor is charged and once quarter numbers are up material is either shifted to back of warehouse to not be touched for another month or loaded back up and shipped back off site.

We had BBQ‘s or a Pot Luck maybe once every quarter. There were lots of recognizing events for retirement, goals met, or a job well done by a group or individual. No longer. Last year according to Mpls. / St. Paul Business Journal, was a great one for senior executives, Graves 2016 year over year compensation up 55%, Oldenkamp, 60%, Bachrach, 34%, Emholz, 56%. Shareholder dividends, @ .30/share are at all-time highs. Employees zero. And to add insult to injury for the first time since forever, there was no end of year employee appreciation lunch.Clearly to Graves and his team, employees are not valued beyond getting as much return on labor for as little investment as possible. So Board of Directors, Graves and anyone he has hired should in my opinion be replaced. Only then might there be a chance that MTS would again be an exceptional place to work. You’d have your cake and the employees could have a small slice too and productivity would be up."

Expect 35-55k. Even if you are a TP performing salesperson, the commission payout is on a sliding scale based off of store percent to budget. Basically they move the goal post mid game. VERY HARD TO EARN A GOOD PAY. If you sell an 8k bed, expect 200 bucks.... terrribleee!. It is a 2.5% commission IF your store hits budget. If not, expect less than 2.5%","Fix your pay structure, or you will lose a ton a good sales people. This is not a product that anybody can sell. It's not easy getting people to spend 2-8k on a matttess."

They give you 2 days off a week and you can often work with your immediate manager if you have any specific schedule needs. I was able as a new employee to attend my grandpas funeral and am very grateful. This was all within my 90 days. I am very excited and can't wait to make Sleep Professional, and then Sleep Expert! They have great national trainers.","The interview process is pretty intense. I would recommend having another job even if you're told you probably got the job. Took me about 6 interviews over the course of several years before I was hired.The goals are pretty high but that's just like any commission job, and similar to bed sales jobs I have had in the past. They have multiple people stores currently I am in a 5 person store. Some of the managers in other stores take more of the ""ups"" and gives less of the Sales Team opportunity to make their goals. It didn't happen to me personally but I've seen people close to their goal and the managers taking more ups than some other stores so that sales person missed their goal.Overall its worth it. Not a good job for you if you cant work hard, and follow up with your customers.","Maybe bring back the raise program, I have a lot to look forward to during my growth but knowing never going to get a raise is a bit discouraging - unless I become manager. I'm not a big fan of the wow points I've heard in the past raises were implemented and I think if you hit your metrics and produce etc after a year or so you should get a raise with the hourly even if its just a little bit. ALSO more contests for employees to win Sleep Number stuff. I worked at another mattress store before this and won multiple beds and even some blankets and what not; made it more motivating to sell and kept morale up."

We have a great warranty and our insiders love our beds..","The company sets very high goals every month and expects us to achieve them. You get written up if you do not make them. They do not take in accountability that you might have a sick day or vacation durning that time. It seams every year it gets higher. Even if the store does not make goal they still write you up. Also the way they have the up system and the lead ownership it's a nightmare! You can work all day and not have an up and your co worker has 3! How is that fair. Corporate needs to reevaluate the policy. Also all the notes you have to put into Seibel to own the lead is redundant, if you miss putting one activity your co worker can take your lead!!! Not fair..There is a lot of favoritism and no accountability. Sleep Number got a tax break and have they passed it on to their employees no. They do not take care of their own. Many companies gave their employees $1,500 and we have seen nothing. Also we at the sales floor spend hours selling the bed but customer service and home delivery can screw up the order and the customer wind up canceling, and we as sales people lose the money.","Come down from your glass tower and see what goes on in the front line.

Be very careful of companies that blur - or, in the case of Sleep Number, disregard - that line.A lot of the gentlemen I worked with (and our crew was 100% male) had a lot of family problems that they dragged with them to work. Sadly, management is all too eager to exploit that kind of dysfunction, rather than promote any kind of work/life balance. To be fair, the field supervisor I was stuck with had maybe the least amount of work/life balance of anybody on the crew. But for the record, Sleep Number habitually violates the DOT 14-hour rule. We had techs go out for 14, 16, even 18 hour adventures, only to be dispatched bright and early the next day.Overall, very dysfunctional, very sad workplace and not something I would recommend to anybody.","DOT regulations are not advice.

Consistently a top performer in my district and and just missed national Presidents club. Found it necessary to seek new employment as my compensation dropped 33 percent in one year. The company is opening up more locations which is fine if you adjust the current store budgets to reflect the new realities of business. The company picks and chooses which store will be allowed to make money based on their own biases by setting either unrealistically high monthly budgets or for certain stores low budgets. The top management is extremely aloof and condescending.The company takes poor performing managers and moves them to different stores instead of finding a better suited position for a manager. (sales)Used to be decent company to work for but has become inconsistent with work environment and pay become unsatisfactory.","In a time of low unemployment and plentiful job opportunities its not a good idea to lower compensation. Including the ridiculous WOW incentive system.Also budget stores based on a verifiable mathematical system as opposed to whoever they like that month.In addition, don't penalize long term employees with unrealistic budgets when opening up new stores only a few miles away.

And this isn't just the opinion of an unhappy former employee. It's also the shared opinion of psychiatric clinicians and law enforcement as well.Many of the people I worked with at Sleep Number had extensive criminal histories, some with felonies, and others had recently been detained for observation at in-patient mental health facilities. By the way, are you a convicted felon or have you recently been held against your will for mental health treatment? Then please consider applying at Sleep Number, because they will hire you.And that is what you can expect working with the regular staff. Sleep Number routinely uses temp workers to help get through busy seasons. In just my six months working there, we had temps pass out on the job, have drug-induced episodes of diarrhea, and one walk off the job while raging on the phone with his parole officer.","Management and R&D are working basically round-the-clock to automate the bed-building process and reduce the amount of contact between their HD techs and their customers, because they understand that many of these people have LOTS of problems that they bring with them to work.

Better than a minimum wage job, where you can also sometimes get over time, can make a bonus by working 40-hour work weeks. Free beverages with your lunch and throughout the day. Intelligent and educated work force--employees are all college graduates.","The company selects a few people to be supervisors and team leaders based on questionable criteria, which often has to do with insider friendships or other non-equitable measures. Many team leaders or scoring directors (project managers) are very good and qualified, but many others show a favoritism and unfair bias about the workers that they don't like for whatever reason. Unfair treatment is tolerated and almost expected. For example, the readers doing their work must keep completely silent, not even crunching a carrot or crinkling a snack bag, but some scoring directors laugh, whisper, talk, or even make a ruckus, with no problem, which can even lead to blaming those who are not at all responsible. This sort of way to do business should not be tolerated and is probably even illegal, but there is no recourse at all because the readers have no job security whatsoever. They are full-time seasonal employees, who must pass certification and testing for every single project and must also meet various weekly levels and standards. There isn't any safety net for the Reader/Scorer employees. Although one can get unemployment, no one tells you that. The ""grapevine"" is the only way that information can be gained about issues that in a normal workplace would be part of an employee handbook or a training. If you don't happen to hear about something through the ""grapevine"" you are not likely to hear about it at all.","There needs to be more information on a regular basis to help the seasonal employees to gain a more comprehensive understanding of benefits and policies that affect them in the workplace. The seasonal employees are not treated like employees, but rather are treated as a replaceable crew. However, Readers that return season after season are actually professional and treat their jobs as a professional position. Their expertise and skill at the job cannot be easily replaced by any warm body with a college degree, but rather, should be given the same legal respect that any full-time employee receives at a job. I think that the standards that the state holds for employees in regular jobs should also hold true at a seasonal employment and to not do so is bad policy. There should be fair and equal treatment of these employees, which is not dependent on the favoritism of certain scoring directors or team leads. Such behavior is certainly unethical and I doubt if it is legal."

They train you thoroughly for anything and everything, which is not necessarily common practice for other residential care providers. ACR is also really good about helping you set up internships for medical-related fields (e.g. OT and PT). If you have no previous work or heathcare-related experience, the pay is pretty reasonable and you will learn a lot.","Whether or not you will enjoy working here all depends on your boss (the Residential Supervisor). I've gone through a couple RS's and the vibes at the house change drastically depending on their personalities and level of engagement. If possible, talk with other people working at the house you're looking to work at or you may end up with an RS who is unengaged, overly demanding on hours, and blatantly and consistently putting themselves before their employees (as my current one does). There's also not a whole lot of opportunities to advance after you've been with the company for more than 3 years or so, but it's a solid job if you're in college and willing to work about 14-21 hours per week (including holidays).","Do not continue replacing RSs with SRSs, it's too demanding on them and the staff and does NOT allow them to fully engage with the lives of the residents at both houses, it's either one or the other."

No one received bonuses the first year I was there even though it was stated in the benefits when I began. The culture is not conducive to learning and development and it operates in silos, which cause major issues. Management is not well prepared for their jobs. We received direct orders to participate in activity which violated SEC filing rules. Even when multiple people brought up issues regarding the practice management used a strong man front and would not listen. When the accounting department found out about it they were stunned and we were audited for as long as I was there after that. The loudest person knows best at Andersen more than any company I've ever been at. Needless to say the culture was toxic. Development opportunities are few and far between. Management in our department was supposed to stay in each role for 7 years! After 7 years in the same position you are not benefiting yourself or the company. Our department did not even participate in making its goals for the year until the year was over. When HR found out about it they were furious. Diversity is almost non-existent at Andersen except in the positions that do not pay as well as the ones, which most white people had. I was told not to use multiple basic business terms that you should know from basic undergraduate business classes. I presume that was because management did not want to admit that he did not know what it meant.","Rules are put in place for a reason. Follow all applicable laws and HR policies where possible.

"914","Andersen","2018-03-07","""IT Job at Andersen? Read This First!""","Former Employee - Anonymous Employee","","Doesn't Recommend","Neutral Outlook","No opinion of CEO","I worked at Andersen full-time","A few of the people are pretty decent and 'get it'.The onsite cafeteria is a nice bonus, especially for breakfast.The compensation is fairly decent as are the benefits.The work from home policy was great.","To better understand the cons you need a little context. For many years working for Andersen was pretty much restricted to family and friends of people who already worked there. It was essentially a generational closed shop. During this period the perks and benefits flowed freely in the form of massive bonuses, profit shares and stock in the company. Consequently, those people stuck around and today the IT department is heavily populated with people who have never worked anywhere else and/or have been at Andersen for 20 to 30+ years. It’s also an open secret that it’s practically impossible to get fired once you’ve become ‘part of the furniture’, despite your obvious lack of professionalism and competence in any given role. All that happens is you’re moved to a different role in a never ending game of merry-go-round until you retire. The effect is to create a culture of self-righteous entitlement and complacency.Some years ago the reins were loosened and ‘outsiders’ were allowed into the IT work force. Therein lies the problem. Newer IT professionals with current skills, knowledge and experience clash with the ‘old school’ dinosaurs. The dinosaurs say they want new and fresh ideas, are open to modernization and improvement, but they’re not. They want things to stay the same. Worse than their blatant dishonesty is their insulting, abusive and condescending behavior directed at anyone who dares to challenge the status quo. They do this with impunity, safe in the knowledge they won’t be written up or fired because management are their buddies and are part of the same ‘old boys network’. It is absolutely astounding and disgusting in equal measure. I literally have never seen or experienced anything quite so toxic or perverted in my entire career.Andersen is an IT backwater. It’s where IT careers go to die. IT management try to defend this on the basis it’s a manufacturing company and thus suffers a greater degree of exposure to the trials and tribulations of the market place. Poppycock! That doesn’t explain running ancient and unsupportable hardware, software that’s many years out of date or blindly following practices which the IT industry moved away from decades ago. They place great emphasis on spending hardly any money on IT. It’s like a badge of honor to these people because it perpetuates the tight fistedness and maintains the status quo the senior execs want to see. You have to understand that at Andersen, IT is seen as overhead. It’s an evil expense that ought to be avoided or reduced at all costs. The same execs appear to not understand it’s actually IT which facilitates business and supports growth rather than inhibits it. Unless of course it’s in a Gartner report. They swallow those things hook, line and sinker. It’s actually quite sad to witness a company’s IT strategy (or a lack thereof) be formed on the basis of the vagaries of a Gartner editor who cannot possibly know anything about Andersen, what it does or how it does it. Very sad. Still, it’s easier than thinking for yourself!Life within IT at Andersen really only fits two categories of people. Interns/college leavers/early career people or people who have given up on their careers and are ready to just settle. The former group won’t know any better so won’t question how bad it is. The latter group most likely will know how bad it is, but won’t have the inclination to do anything about it. For everyone else who has worked hard to develop their IT specialty, forget about it. After being lied to by omission at the interview, your time at Andersen will go through three phases.Phase 1 is the honeymoon phase. You will identify what’s wrong within your area of specialty and will plan and strategize how to fix, change and improve it. In other words, do what you think you’re being paid for. You will get smiles, nods of appreciation and pats on the back as management smugly reflects on how clever they think they are for hiring you. Phase 2 is the push back phase. This is where you’ll discover few to none of your ideas will be implemented because there’s no budget for it, it’s always been done that way or one or more of the dinosaurs doesn’t like it or you because you’ve had the audacity to point out how antiquated, non-compliant or just plain wrong things are. Phase 3 is the blame phase. Frustrated at not being able to make any progress and having witnessed the daily evaporation of your skill set through a lack of use, you’ll eventually be blamed for not fitting in. That’s right, YOU are the problem! You’re not getting along with the dinosaurs (the same ones who have insulted and berated you), you’re not being supportive, you’re not a team player, etc. Management don’t seem to realize it’s the people who do speak up and do want to change and improve things are actually the ones who care. However, it’s more important at Andersen to get along and be everyone’s friend than it is to be really good at what you do. Eventually you’ll leave only to be replaced by the next wide eyed innocent who will be their next victim.My words are not the bitter ramblings of someone who was fired. They are my objective observations of what I and others experienced. I left of my own accord and at a time which was both right and convenient for me. I have no axe to grind other than to warn people about what they’re getting into. Bottom line is, if you’re in either of the two categories mentioned earlier, you’ll probably do fine at Andersen. However, if you’re really good at what you do and care passionately about your IT career, don’t work there. You’ll regret it. You have been warned.","The whole of IT is overseen by someone who has an accounting background. Draw your own conclusions."

Traditional author base is as strong as anyone's in the business.","A non-technology company cannot simply snap its fingers and become a technology service provider (similarly a non-Agile organization cannot transform to Agile overnight by merely adopting a popular large-scale method). The profit is there, but it doesn't seem to be enough for The Street. RIFs, and reorgs now happen at regular intervals. Intellectual property, once a driving force, is slowly eroding as the overall organization struggles with developing new platforms. Outside consultants seem to drive all strategy. Outsourcing of positions is becoming very common. The company seems to struggle with ""who"" the competition is. It will get worse before it gets better.","Upper management carries on, even after controversy and a lack of ability to deliver ample new revenue models. Upper management should, once and for all, own it, and stop blaming past management, market conditions, or shifting educational demographics. Advise not to say something like ""we're going to disrupt education"" -- frankly, it's a little late, and it only looks like another grasp at a straw."

There are several websites to do the different tasks, one of the websites you have to log out and log back in in order to go to a different page, the representatives who are supposed to help you on the phone can be very difficult to understand (and that is NOT some racist thing about them being overseas - it's just how it is), and the people often can't find you in the system so you have to call back or call a different number to get help, there are several places you need to login and some of them don't work (the web pages are confusing and some of the items don't work correctly). I could go on all day. Trying to figure all this stuff out will leach hours from your life, unpaid hours, and you're not getting paid that much. In fact, it's embarrassing how little people get paid when you take into consideration what the CEO of Pearson makes and the bonuses he and his friends just got. They couldn't make this stuff any more confusing if they tried. Honestly. And I'm not an idiot when it comes to computers and websites - I have a lot of experience. Pearson needs to pony up and integrate their systems, streamline them and make it easier for people to use. It is ridiculous.","See above.

Example the TIP, Technical Innovation Pipeline, is supposed to be a crowd driven voting site that allows any of the 300K employees to vote / comment on potential product / process novelty / improvement. But the participation is so random, they tend to upvote ideas which are often impractical but politically popular ( for example deer detection and warning on highways, etc.). They do tend to get filtered out but good ideas that do not get the amount of visibility just don't enter consideration.Employees tend to be more politically driven and make decisions for improving self and their standing often at the expense of the company. Decisions are made that do not benefit the company or its subscribers. Example, some one in the planning group had a bright idea to introduce a new technology that is the rage and developing fast. The technology was aimed at supplanting a tried, tested and very matured one that was working quite well. Migrating to this would have meant a significant shift in retraining existing personnel, investing in equipment, design, installation of the new architecture to incorporate the new technology with significant time. The bugs ironed out with tried technology over almost 5 years resulted in a stable system and by introducing a new untested technology we would risk starting afresh with new problems impacting not only our capex, opex budgets but also value to the customer because service costs will increase and quality will decrease. Instead of being the guinea pigs and investing in new untried and untested technologies, the decision to hold off till there is substantial standardization and adoption was clearly unpopular among proponents that were forward looking and bullish on its prospects. The end result is buying a whole lot of equipment which, because it clearly was not able to standup to its hype, ended up occupying racks and racks of inventory, space, power and sinking investment that further drove up costs to the subscribers who are already teetering on cutting the cord.While bidding on ATT proposals, many vendors take into consideration the bureaucracy and the layers involved in the decision making and often inflate their costs by 100-200%. Even though employee are not supposed to receive gifts which can cause conflicts of interests, things do go on ( upgrades at hotels for conferences, lavish banquets, and numerous unseen, under the table arrangements / incentives that drive vendors to make themselves favorable in the ""neutral"" bake-offs / technology assessments).Even while booking hotels, you can sometimes find that the ATT rate is higher than the rack rate which is another example of how costs are not properly controlled.300K employees are marshalled like an army, with a highly vertical & siloed organization that often makes decisions that are not effective for the average employee. For example, atleast 2 hours a day may be spent on training, conference calls and processes that add very little to the output.There is no transparency and one group often does not have any idea what another group is doing, so there are needless duplication and ""reinventing the wheel"" type situations. The access to facilities also is highly restricted, so the organization is not conducive to cross pollination of ideas except informally which is infrequent and therefore quite unlikely.Pointless mergers: ATT has a penchant for losing money on mergers ( DirecTV) , failed mergers ( T Mo 4 billion$ breakup fees) and killing acquisitions ( Quick Play) etc. Example, why would anyone purchase a company worth 25B$ for 70B$ ( assuming DTV’s 20B$ debt), DirecTV despite being in operation for 3 decades, had a debt of 20B and the total value of their Satellite plant / uplink facilities / 20Million CPE was about 25B$. ATT could have simply acquired these subscribers by merely building a better mouse trap. Instead it had to take on additional debt to acquire DirecTV, a process that took several years while most of the projects were on hold, which was basically loss in employee productivity and irrecoverable costs of stalled programs / investments. After the merger, there was significant effort in the alignment of workforce, culture etc. After nearly 4 years post acquisition, the culture match is so strained that there are rumors that ATT will spit up the “difficult to assimilate” acquisition but will need to stomach a hefty loss in the process. Whichever way we look at it, its going to be expensive ( loss making proposition) to hold on to DirecTV and it will cost dearly to let it go as well.","DirecTV came to be in its current predicament because it was not cognizant of the costs. It had an overwhelming reliance on IT technologies and came to hire numerous Indian IT professionals into its ranks that were mostly concerned with process, skills and agile development as they usually are but blinded by its impacts to subscriber value. ATT is an operator and the choices are vendor based. Obviously there is a fundamental difference in approaching the problem itself.Even their CPE inventory is huge, just merely providing a dish to a subscriber, there are atleast 30 different options which require holding inventory at some warehouse, the CPE setup is complex and requires truck rolls etc. , the choices are also quite extensive ( DVR, no DVR, Wifi capable etc etc). Most of the development is done in house which is not necessarily a cost saver but it leads to spending needlessly on aspects that do not concern an operator (as opposed to buying from a vendor who does the development and testing) .When the premise in acquiring DirectTV was to get a bargaining power for content acquisition, the steady stream of cord cutters is obviously not going to help. DirecTV had 21 M subs and ATT's UVERSE had 6 M subs at their peak, and now it is 19M for DirecTV and 3M for UVERSE, a decrease of 18% in 4 years. The DirecTV NOW product promoted by the AppleTV / Roku giveaways managed to build a 1.2 M subs in less than 18 months, but the costs involved ( 3rd party CDN, Cloud computing or building additional encode facilities to support multiple bitrates for ABR- HLS, DASH) strain the economics and it is not a stretch of imagination that these novel OTT streams are but new ways to lose money.To consider that DirecTV NOW was a strategy to bundle wireless services, the additional costs in providing video over wireless ( increased data traffic, increased spectrum utilization, density of base stations etc), it may not be possible to realize this as a cash positive strategy. Video is not something that a regular networking chap can treat as an IT function. Most of the so called architects in DirecTV are glorified IT guys with little or no experience in the video head end nor of the problems that seasoned video professionals can recognize and resolve. This is why you all end up barking up the wrong tree more often than not because you lack the insight of traditional video people,Whatever growth the company reports is not because of efficiencies or cost management but because they are passing on the costs to the subscribers.Customer acquisition , retention, support call centers are almost like gladiatorial pits, where employees are let loose among beasts, obviously turnover is rampant, because the stress levels are unimaginable. THIS is not how a CENTURY OLD TELECOM company has to fare. It should start with great products, transparent pricing, effortless service not hiding behind contracts, early termination fees, bait and switch, opportunistic pricing.First and foremost, focus has to be on providing customer unmatched value and to create a business that produces greater returns through higher volumes and thinner margins. As the network grows, evolving it becomes increasingly harder, so the current strategy of SDN/NFV/Domain 2.0 is the right approach to ensure less reliance on white box vendor offerings which were marketed as the ""emperor's new clothes""."
